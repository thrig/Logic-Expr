Revision history for Logic-Expr

0.02    2022-03-29
	    Second version, released to a somewhat less
	    unsuspecting world.
        * Rework module internals to better allow multiple expressions
          to be parsed together. This removes the atoms, bools
          methods, and adds some internal state that may need a
          "reset" call to clear it.
        * Add "codex" method that generates a function that can be
          called to solve the expression.
        * Add a "walk" method (used by "codex").
        * Optional argument to "solutions" to better work with code that
          generates solutions for multiple expressions.
        * eg/solver may be of interest.
        * Fix a postderef form that shouldn't have been there with the
          perl requirements set as low as they are.
        * Fix the all_pod_coverage_ok.
        * Fix the Build.PL requirements.
